# TicTacToe

This was a simple project that was an assignment while I was at the Institute for Advanced Analytics taking a Python course. Most of the requirements were quite straight forward as you might expect with an exercise to implement a simple tic-tac-toe game. The specifics of the requirements can be find here: https://www.csc2.ncsu.edu/faculty/healey/msa/python/assn-tictactoe/

I thought it would be fun to implement a the tic-tac-toe game as a class rather than just a script in a loop. As always, there are plenty of improvements that can be made, but I am satisfied with the product as it sits. I am proud to showcase it here knowing the progress I have made as a programmer.

Completing the assignment gave me the confidence to study and pass the Python Institute's PCAP-31-03 certification, which you can see my credential here:
